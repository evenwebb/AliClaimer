## 📖 How It Works

When an order isn't delivered within 7 days, AliExpress may offer a **£1 coupon** as compensation. Normally, you have to manually check each order page and click "Collect". This extension automates that process:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[🌐 Navigate] --> B[🔍 Scan]
    B --> C[👆 Visit]
    C --> D[💰 Claim]
    D --> E[📈 Track]
```

1. **🌐 Navigate** - Automatically clicks the "Processed" tab to show only delivered orders
2. **🔍 Scan** - Collects all order links from the page
3. **👆 Visit** - Opens each order detail page in sequence
4. **💰 Claim** - Clicks the "Collect" button when a late delivery coupon is found
5. **📈 Track** - Displays real-time statistics of progress

## 🚀 Installation

### From Source (Developer Mode)

> **⚠️ Important:** Choose a permanent location for the extension folder before loading it. Don't delete or move the folder after installation, as Chrome will lose access to the extension files.

1. **Download the Repository**

   Choose one of these methods:

   **Option A - Git Clone (Recommended)**
   ```bash
   # Clone to a permanent location (e.g., ~/Projects/)
   cd ~/Projects/
   git clone https://github.com/evenwebb/AliClaimer.git
   ```

   **Option B - Download ZIP**
   - Click the green "Code" button on GitHub
   - Select "Download ZIP"
   - Extract to a **permanent location** (e.g., `~/Projects/AliClaimer/`)
   - ⚠️ Don't extract to Downloads - it may get deleted!

2. **Open Chrome Extensions**
   - Navigate to `chrome://extensions/`
   - Enable **Developer mode** (toggle in top right corner)

3. **Load the Extension**
   - Click **Load unpacked**
   - Navigate to and select the `AliClaimer` folder
   - Make sure you select the folder containing `manifest.json`

4. **Done!** The extension icon should now appear in your browser toolbar

> 💡 **Tip:** Keep the folder where you put it. If you move or delete it, you'll need to reload the extension.

> **💡 Tip:** Want to see which orders have coupons without claiming them?

3. 🚫 No coupons will be claimed - perfect for checking before you claim

### Tips & Tricks

- ⏸️ **Can resume** - Stop and restart anytime; it will continue from the order list

---

## 🔍 What It Looks For

The extension searches for **"Collect"** buttons inside `.item-action` elements - specifically the ones that appear with the message:

> *"Sorry for the late delivery. As compensation here's a £1.00 coupon code."*
